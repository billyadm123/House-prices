I was given the King County House Sales dataset to analyse and find the features that would best determine the house sales price.  After exploring the data and cleaning the data, I am confident that I chose the best features.
I chose the following features for my meachine learning model:
<li>bedroomsNumber - of Bedrooms/House
<li>bathroomsNumber - of bathrooms/bedrooms
<li>sqft_living - footage of the home
<li>floorsTotal - floors (levels) in house
<li>waterfront - House which has a view to a waterfront
<li>view - Has been viewed
<li>grade - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
<li>sqft_above - square footage of house apart from basement
<li>sqft_basement - square footage of the basement
<li>zipcode - zip
<li>lat - Latitude coordinate
<li>sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
<li>sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors</li>
All these features put together in a multivariate linear regression model got a score of .77.
