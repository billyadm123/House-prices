I was given the King County House Sales dataset to analyse and find the features that would best determine the house sales price.  After exploring the data and cleaning the data, I am confident that I chose the best features.
I chose the following features for my meachine learning model:
<li>bedroomsNumber - of Bedrooms/House
bathroomsNumber - of bathrooms/bedrooms
sqft_living - footage of the home
floorsTotal - floors (levels) in house
waterfront - House which has a view to a waterfront
view - Has been viewed
grade - overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
sqft_above - square footage of house apart from basement
sqft_basement - square footage of the basement
zipcode - zip
lat - Latitude coordinate
sqft_living15 - The square footage of interior housing living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
sqft_lot15 - The square footage of the land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors</li>
All these features put together in a multivariate linear regression model got a score of .77.
